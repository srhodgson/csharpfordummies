# csharpfordummies

For anyone that might be interested, this repository is just somewhere to store 
things as I go back over C# For Dummies.

Why am I going back over it?

I've spent alot of time working in other languages recently and thought that this
would be a relatively quick way of refreshing my memory by working over some of 
the tasks etc in the book.
